# 🧬 See Your Future Health  
**Making Population Health Science Understandable, Visual, and Personal**

> A science-backed, non-diagnostic health visualization tool built for the **Kaggle Gemini-3 Competition**, powered by Gemini as an interpretation layer.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**See Your Future Health** is an interactive, educational web application that helps people understand how **today’s lifestyle choices statistically shape future health outcomes**.

Health science already tells us a lot about aging, disease risk, and prevention — but that knowledge lives in **scientific papers, population models, and clinical frameworks** that are often inaccessible to non-experts. This project bridges that gap.

Instead of diagnosing or predicting individual medical outcomes, the app translates **trusted population-level health science** into **clear, visual, and personalized projections** that anyone can explore.

---

## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

- 🧠 Scientific health research is **hard to interpret** for non-professionals  
- 📄 Public-health guidelines are **fragmented and abstract**
- 🔢 Risk scores often feel **opaque and disconnected from daily life**
- ❓ People struggle to answer:
  > *“What do my habits today mean for my health in 5–10 years?”*

**See Your Future Health** answers this question in an **intuitive, transparent, and non-diagnostic way**.

---

## 🧩 Core Ideas

- **Education, not diagnosis**  
  This tool does *not* provide medical advice or clinical diagnoses.

- **Population science → personal understanding**  
  We use established models and open data to show *statistical trends*, not certainties.

- **Explainability first**  
  Every metric, projection, and insight is traceable to known public-health frameworks.

---

## 🧪 Scientific Foundations & Trusted Sources

The app is built on **established and widely recognized frameworks**, including:

- ❤️ **American Heart Association — Life’s Essential 8 (LE8)**  
  Used as the core cardiovascular health score
- 🌍 **World Health Organization (WHO)** guidelines  
  Physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol, sedentary behavior
- 🇺🇸 **CDC & public epidemiological models**  
  Diabetes and cardiovascular risk estimation
- 📚 Peer-reviewed population studies (used conservatively and transparently)

When data is missing, **explicit proxy assumptions** are used and clearly labeled.

## 🖥️ Key Features

### 📊 Health Scoring & Projections
- AHA **Life’s Essential 8 score** (current + 10-year outlook)
- Type 2 Diabetes risk estimation
- Cardiovascular risk indicators
- Weight trajectory projections

### 🔀 Scenario Comparison
Explore how different lifestyle paths affect long-term outcomes:
- Status Quo
- Small Changes
- Big Changes

Each scenario updates:
- Health score trajectory
- Weight trend
- Risk milestones

---

### 🧠 Health Trajectory Milestones
A timeline of **key predicted health events**, such as:
- Risk reductions after quitting smoking
- Improvements from sustained activity
- Reaching “excellent” cardiovascular health

These milestones help users *understand progression*, not just endpoints.

---

### 🧠 AI Health Assistant (Gemini)
Gemini is used as an **interpretation and explanation layer**, not a predictor.

Users can ask:
- *“Why is this risk high or low?”*
- *“What would happen if I change X?”*
- *“How confident is this estimate?”*

Gemini responds with:
- Clear explanations
- Bullet-point reasoning
- References to trusted public-health sources
- Answers tailored to the user’s actual inputs

---

### 🧍‍♀️ 3D Human Model (Educational Context)
A 3D anatomical model provides **visual grounding**:
- Highlights organs associated with specific risks
- Helps users connect abstract data to the human body
- Reinforces learning rather than clinical interpretation

---

## 🔍 Transparency & Safety

- 🚫 **No diagnosis**
- 🧾 **Clear disclaimers**
- 🔍 Explicit labeling of:
  - Estimated values
  - Proxy assumptions
  - Population-level uncertainty
- 🧠 Designed for **education and awareness**, not treatment decisions

---

## 🏆 Competition Context

This project was built for the **Kaggle Gemini-3 Competition**, showcasing:

- Real-world application of Gemini as an **explanation engine**
- Responsible AI use in a **health-adjacent domain**
- Focus on **clarity, trust, and interpretability**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (High Level)

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript
- **Visualization:** Custom charts & timelines
- **AI:** Gemini (via Google AI Studio)
- **Design:** UX focused on clarity and confidence
- **Data:** Open public-health guidelines & population models

---

## 🌱 Why This Matters

Most people don’t need another risk score.  
They need **understanding**.

**See Your Future Health** helps users:
- See patterns instead of numbers
- Understand trade-offs instead of absolutes
- Learn how habits compound over time

It turns health science into something **approachable, explorable, and human**.
